## üéØ HOOK (15 seconds)

**[Pause - look at audience]**

"Last year, a user clicked on what looked like PancakeSwap.com. It was the #1 Google search result. Within minutes, their wallet was drained ‚Äì $40,000 gone.

The link? A phishing site that paid for Google ads.

**This is the reality of Web3 today.**"

## üìä PROBLEM STATEMENT (60 seconds)

### **Problem 1: Too Complex & Risky for New Users**

According to research published on HackerNoon, **poor user experience is the #1 barrier holding back Web3 adoption** ([source](https://hackernoon.com/how-poor-user-experience-is-holding-back-web3-adoption)).

The numbers back this up:
- **67% of interested users avoid DeFi** because interfaces are too complex
- **78% cite security concerns** as their top worry
- Only **15% of current DeFi users** are non-technical people

Think about that ‚Äì **85% of DeFi users are crypto-native**. We're failing to reach mainstream users.

### **Problem 2: Fragmented Web3 Experience**

Want to swap tokens? Open ALEX.
Check your NFTs? Go to another site.
Stack STX? Different platform.
Check DeFi analytics? Yet another tab.

Users are **juggling 5-10 different websites** just to manage their crypto. It's exhausting.

### **Problem 3: Not Safe ‚Äì Phishing is Rampant**

Real incidents:
- **PancakeSwap fake domains** bought Google Ads, appearing as #1 search result
- **Kevin Rose** (Proof Collective founder) lost high-value NFTs worth millions to a phishing link
- **$300 million lost to crypto phishing in 2023 alone** according to Chainalysis

Even experienced users get caught. What chance do newcomers have?

## üìã VALIDATION: We Asked Real Users (20 seconds)

"Don't just take our word for it. We surveyed **67 university students** ‚Äì the next generation of crypto users.

**17 responses** confirmed our hypothesis:
- Majority found DeFi platforms **'confusing' or 'intimidating'**
- Most wouldn't try DeFi without guidance
- Top concern? **'I'm afraid of losing my money'**

This is the generation that grew up with smartphones. If *they* find Web3 too hard, **we have a serious problem.**"

## üí° SOLUTION: Meet Blasko (45 seconds)

**[Show demo or architecture diagram]**

"We built **Blasko** ‚Äì the first AI-powered DeFi assistant for Stacks blockchain.

Instead of this [gesture multiple tabs], you get this [show chat interface]:

**Just talk:**
- *'What's my balance?'* ‚Äì Done.
- *'Swap 10 STX for USDA'* ‚Äì AI finds best price across ALEX, Velar, Bitflow.
- *'Show my NFTs'* ‚Äì Beautiful gallery appears.
- *'How do I stack STX?'* ‚Äì AI explains using official documentation.

**One interface. Natural language. 17 AI-powered tools.**

Security? Built-in. We integrate with **trusted wallets** like Leather and Hiro. AI prepares transactions, **you approve with your wallet**. We never touch your funds.

Complexity? Gone. You don't need to understand slippage, AMMs, or smart contracts. Just tell Blasko what you want.

**We're making DeFi as easy as texting a friend.**"

## üèÜ WHY BLASKO WINS (20 seconds)

"Why is Blasko different?

**8 AI crypto assistants exist** ‚Äì none serve Stacks.
**Zero comprehensive solutions** for Bitcoin DeFi.

We're not just another chatbot. We have:
- ‚úÖ Real integrations with ALEX, Velar, Bitflow
- ‚úÖ 17 functional tools, not promises
- ‚úÖ Working prototype you can try today
- ‚úÖ The ONLY AI assistant built specifically for Stacks

We didn't guess what users need. **We validated the problem, then built the solution.**"

---

## üöÄ CLOSING (15 seconds)

**[Confident, clear]**

"**67% of people avoid DeFi** because it's too complex.

**Blasko fixes that.**

We're bringing DeFi to everyone ‚Äì not just crypto experts.

The Stacks ecosystem has **$200M in TVL** but zero accessible tools.

**That changes today.**

Thank you. Let's make Web3 accessible."

**[Smile, pause for applause, ready for Q&A]**

**Q: Monetization?**
A: "Free tier drives adoption. Premium features, DEX referral fees, protocol partnerships, enterprise API."

**Q: Traction?**
A: "Fully functional prototype with real integrations. Ready for community beta Q1 2025."
