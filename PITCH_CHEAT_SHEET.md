## ❓ Q&A QUICK ANSWERS

### Q: Different from ChatGPT?
**A:** "Deep protocol integration, can execute transactions, wallet-aware, Stacks-specific. ChatGPT can't do any of this."

### Q: What if AI makes mistakes?
**A:** "Users confirm all transactions via wallet. AI prepares, users approve. We never control funds."

### Q: Why Stacks not Ethereum?
**A:** "Underserved market, early mover advantage, Bitcoin integration. Better to own 80% of Stacks than 1% of Ethereum."

### Q: Monetization?
**A:** "Free tier + Premium ($5-10/mo), DEX referral fees, protocol partnerships, enterprise API. Users first, revenue follows."

### Q: User acquisition?
**A:** "Bottom-up: Stacks community launch, protocol partnerships, content marketing, referral program, organic growth."

### Q: AI hallucinations?
**A:** "Structured outputs, tool validation, official APIs, user confirmation. AI prepares, blockchain validates, user approves."
