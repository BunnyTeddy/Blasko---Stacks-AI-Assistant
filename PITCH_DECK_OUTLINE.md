### **Slide 1: HOOK / PROBLEM**
⏱️ Time: 30 seconds

#### Visual:
- Split screen showing:
  - Left: Complex DEX interface with arrows everywhere
  - Right: Simple Blasko chat: "Swap 10 STX for USDA" ✅

#### What to Say:
> "Have you ever tried to use DeFi and felt completely lost? You're not alone. 
> 
> 67% of people interested in DeFi never use it because it's too complex. 
> 
> What if interacting with your blockchain was as easy as texting a friend?"

#### Key Stats:

### **Slide 2: THE PROBLEM (Deep Dive)**
⏱️ Time: 45 seconds

#### Visual:
7 pain points as icons with brief text:
1. 😵 Complex interfaces
2. ❌ Unclear error messages
3. 🌐 Network confusion
4. 🔒 Security concerns
5. 📚 Information overload
6. 🤷 No guidance
7. ⏰ Time-consuming

#### What to Say:
> "We did deep research into WHY people avoid DeFi. We found 7 major pain points:
> 
> Users face complex interfaces they don't understand.
> Error messages make no sense - 'Slippage too high' - what does that mean?
> Multiple networks and tokens create confusion.
> Security concerns keep 78% of users away.
> There's too much information with no guide to help.
> 
> One user told us: 'I wanted to try DeFi but gave up after 2 hours trying to swap tokens.'
> 
> This is the barrier we need to break."

#### Supporting Evidence:
- User research from 2024-2025 DeFi UX studies

## ❓ ANTICIPATED Q&A

### Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT with crypto plugins?"
**A:** 
"ChatGPT plugins are read-only and generic. Blasko has:
1. Deep Stacks protocol integration (can actually execute transactions)
2. Wallet-aware context (knows YOUR wallet)
3. Visual components for NFTs, charts, analytics
4. Built specifically for Stacks ecosystem, not generic blockchain
5. Chat history and persistent context"

### Q: "What if AI makes a mistake and loses user funds?"
**A:**
"Great question. Safety is paramount:
1. All transactions require user wallet confirmation - AI can't execute without approval
2. We show transaction details before execution
3. Wallet integration handles security (Leather, Hiro, etc.)
4. AI provides information and prepares transactions, user has final control
5. Future: Add transaction simulation and risk warnings"

### Q: "Why should users trust this?"
**A:**
"Trust is built through:
1. Open development - users can see what we're doing
2. Integration with trusted protocols (ALEX, Velar, etc.)
3. Wallet security handled by established wallet providers
4. No custody - we never hold user funds
5. Transparent AI reasoning (users see why AI recommends something)"

### Q: "What's your monetization strategy?"
**A:**
"Multiple paths:
1. **Free tier** for basic features (drive adoption)
2. **Premium tier** for advanced analytics, priority support ($5-10/mo)
3. **DEX referral fees** from swaps (standard in industry)
4. **Protocol partnerships** for featured integrations
5. **Enterprise API** for other apps to integrate Blasko
6. Focus on users first, monetization follows"

### Q: "Why Stacks and not Ethereum/Solana?"
**A:**
"Strategic choice:
1. **Underserved market** - no existing solution
2. **Bitcoin integration** - unique positioning
3. **Early mover advantage** - establish dominance
4. **Manageable scope** - can go deep on Stacks protocols
5. **Future expansion** - framework can extend to other chains
6. Better to own 80% of Stacks than 1% of Ethereum"

### Q: "What's your user acquisition strategy?"
**A:**
"Bottom-up community approach:
1. **Launch in Stacks community** (Discord, Twitter, Reddit)
2. **Protocol partnerships** (ALEX, Velar feature us)
3. **Content marketing** (tutorials, Twitter threads)
4. **Hackathon presence** (Stacks events, Bitcoin conferences)
5. **Referral program** (invite friends, get benefits)
6. **Organic growth** (if product is good, users share it)"

### Q: "How do you handle AI hallucinations?"
**A:**
"Multiple safeguards:
1. **Structured outputs** - AI returns specific data formats, not free text
2. **Tool validation** - Each tool validates inputs/outputs
3. **Source data** - All blockchain data from official APIs
4. **User confirmation** - Show details before execution
5. **Continuous improvement** - Monitor and fix errors
6. **Future: RAG system** - Ground AI in verified Stacks documentation"

### Q: "What's your technical moat?"
**A:**
"Several layers:
1. **Deep protocol knowledge** - 17 tools with real integrations
2. **Stacks expertise** - First-mover advantage
3. **AI tool architecture** - Extensible framework
4. **User experience** - Not just functional, but delightful
5. **Network effects** - More users = better product (AI learns)
6. **Community trust** - Takes time to build
7. **Future: Proprietary AI model** fine-tuned on Stacks/DeFi"
