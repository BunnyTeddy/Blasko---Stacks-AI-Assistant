# Blasko - AI-Powered DeFi Assistant for Stacks

An AI agent that makes blockchain interaction as simple as conversation. Built for the Stacks Vibe Coding Hackathon.

## The Problem

Blockchain has three critical barriers preventing mainstream adoption:

### First: Complexity

ICODA Research found **89% of new users abandon DeFi** because it's too complicated. Sending crypto means:
- Copying 42-character wallet addresses without making a single mistake
- Calculating gas fees in "gwei"â€”a term that means nothing to normal people
- Understanding "slippage tolerance"
- Selecting the right network or risk losing funds

This is not user-friendly. This is gatekeeping.

### Second: Fragmentation

Users juggle 5+ different platforms:
- One website to check balance
- Another to swap tokens
- Another for NFTs
- Another for transaction history
- Another to learn how things work

Different interfaces, different logins. It's exhausting and insecure.

### Third: Phishing

In January 2023, tech investor Kevin Rose lost **$1.1 million in NFTs** to a phishing link. Chainalysis reports phishing attacks increased **400% from 2022 to 2024**. If experts get scammed, regular users don't stand a chance.

### Campus Survey Validation

To validate this problem, I conducted a 6-question survey in Vietnamese among **67 students** in our Computer Science program.

**Results:**
- Only **13 responded** (19% response rate)
- **53.8%** said DeFi interfaces are too complex
- **46.2%** are worried about security and losing money
- **23.1%** tried DeFi once or twice, then gave up
- Only **7.7%** (1 student) uses DeFi regularly
- **69.3%** said an AI assistant using natural language would help

The demand is real.

## The Solution

Blasko is an AI agent that lets you interact with blockchain through natural conversation.

### How It Works

Instead of copying addresses across multiple websites, you simply chat:

```
You: "Resolve alice.btc"
Blasko: "alice.btc resolves to SP2J6ZY... [shows address]"

You: "Send 10 STX there"
Blasko: "Here's your transaction ready to sign [shows form]"
```

Natural language. One interface. No technical jargon.

### 18 Specialized Tools

Blasko isn't a chatbot that talks *about* blockchainâ€”it's an AI agent that *operates* blockchain:

**Transaction Tools:**
- `sendToken` - Send STX or fungible tokens
- `multiSend` - Bulk send to 200 recipients in ONE transaction
- `swapToken` - DEX integration via ALEX
- `bridgeToken` - BTC â†” sBTC bridge
- `stackStx` - Lock STX to earn Bitcoin rewards

**Query Tools:**
- `getAccount` - Fetch balances and transaction history
- `getTransaction` - Detailed transaction info
- `getContract` - View smart contract source code
- `getNftGallery` - Display NFT collection

**BNS (Identity) Tools:**
- `resolveBNS` - Convert names to addresses
- `reverseLookupBNS` - Convert addresses to names
- `registerBNS` - Check availability and register names

**DeFi Analytics Tools:**
- `getStacksTVL` - Total Value Locked charts
- `getTopProtocols` - Ranked DeFi protocols
- `getDefiCategories` - DeFi category breakdown
- `getProtocolInfo` - Detailed protocol information

**Knowledge Tool:**
- `getStacksKnowledge` - RAG-powered documentation search with AI synthesis

### Safety Advantages

Blasko addresses the phishing epidemic:

âœ… **Single Trusted Interface** - No clicking suspicious links  
âœ… **Automatic Name Resolution** - No copy-paste errors  
âœ… **Clear Transaction Previews** - No hidden fees

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blasko.git
cd blasko
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Hiro API Key for Stacks blockchain
HIRO_API_KEY=your_hiro_api_key_here

# Google Generative AI API Key for Gemini
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Connect Your Wallet:** Click "Connect Wallet" in the sidebar
2. **Start Chatting:** Type natural language requests like:
   - "What's my balance?"
   - "Send 10 STX to alice.btc"
   - "Swap 5 STX for USDA"
   - "Show me my NFTs"
   - "What is stacking?"
3. **Review & Confirm:** Blasko generates transaction forms for you to review
4. **Sign with Wallet:** Approve transactions in your Stacks wallet
